I had to use canary Chrome to do this. The oscillators isn't implemented in stable Chrome yet. Dunno about dev channel.

Just some basic oscillators to mr.doob's neat particles.

Written far too late into the night. Has a slight clipping going on, but I thought it sounded pretty sweet.

Try changing the beatInterval variable. You can also try turning a delay on and of with the useDelay varaible. It became kinda excessive though after I did a random time offset for the second oscillator.

Spacebar stops scheduling of notes, so it's not an instant mute, but it will stop the music.
